# LSTM Ṭubūʻ Music generator

This project is inspired from Valerio Velardo works on 'rnn' and time series based music generation (https://github.com/musikalkemist).
Thanks!
- The data set is from TMSD by Ahmed Ben Sassi (https://github.com/bensassi-ahmed/TMSD).
- To handle microtonal bends, I used pretty_midi instead of music21.
- Future patch will include : layer optimisation, seed generator and multi-format exporter.
